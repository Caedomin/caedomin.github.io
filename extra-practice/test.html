            <li class=" noBgColor"><strong>From your personal experience, what have been key behaviors in effective
                    teams?</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>The most effective teams I have either seen from a distance or directly been a part of have always
                    started their first initial meeting with a little human interaction for the purpose of introduction.
                    This would happen through getting to know one another for the first time, discussing expectations of
                    the gathering or individual roles in an organization. This kind of initial communication with each
                    member of the group allowed for increased trust and openness between group members. Subsequent
                    meetings wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily need this same beginning to a gathering but it&rsquo;s crucial
                    for the first meeting.</li>
                <li>Another key behavior I have seen come from successful teams is the setting of clear expectations.
                    This includes, but is not limited to, all members understanding the following before the meeting
                    begins:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>how the meeting will proceed, (who is expected to engage when and how)</li>
                    <li>responsibilities during and after the meeting,</li>
                    <li>and when follow-up meetings will occur (if applicable).</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li class=" noBgColor"><strong>What do group norms have to do with effective team building? What would you say your
                current B321 group norms include (unspoken and spoken norms)? Are they healthy group norms? If not what
                could be changed?</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>According to the reading, "the right norms... could raise a group&rsquo;s collective intelligence, whereas
                    the wrong norms could hobble a team, even if, individually, all the members were exceptionally
                    bright." Furthermore, there is no "one-size-fits-all" approach to the perfect team environment; what
                    works for one group may not work for another. So long as a team can find healthy communication
                    habits that allow for all members to feel included, valued, and ultimately treated humanely, a team
                    can flourish in accomplishing their goals. The key is that last part, being socially sensitive to
                    each other, recognizing if something is or is not working for any one member of the group and
                    adjusting where necessary.</li>
                <li>Though we&rsquo;ve only met once, our group seems to have a supportive, socially sensitive culture that&rsquo;s
                    allowed for every member to participate freely and regularly in discussion. Everyone displayed
                    professionalism arriving on-time, being prepared, and all provided high-level thought to the
                    discussion. I felt comfortable to ask questions and voice my true thoughts without reservation;
                    which, in my opinion, is a good indication of a team with healthy norms.</li>
            </ul>
            <li class=" noBgColor"><strong>How does psychological safety in a team increase overall effectiveness? What are the
                roles of communication and empathy in creating psychological safety?</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>To demonstrate the role of psychological safety in a team, imagine your brain could offend your leg in a heated conversation about how it&rsquo;s not walking fast enough. If that leg was psychologically feeling unsafe, feeling less valued than the other appendages, it might not wish to walk at all any more. Good luck trying to sprint with a dumb limp in your stride whenever that leg was needed. The same goes for human team members; one must feel safe in a team environment for all to benefit from that member&rsquo;s skills and capacity. An example from the reading defined psychological safety as, "a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish someone for speaking up."</li>
                    <li>"Being professional" is a broad term commonly used to summarize many desired behaviors in various social circumstances. Many of which behaviors include respect and being receptive to another&rsquo;s viewpoint or commentary without reacting in a way that intimidates others to believe they are emotionally or psychologically unsafe.</li>
                </ul> 
            <li class=" noBgColor"><strong>How does sharing personal experience and being vulnerable influence team dynamics?
                (Think of the example of Sakaguchi.) Do you have any personal examples of this in organizations you are
                involved in?</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Respectful vulnerability can go a long way to breaking barriers of trust or establishing connections with an audience. Expressing vulnerability tells your audience "I trust you with my sensitive, private information; you can trust me in return." That trust often forms relationship glue between teammates, which solidifies into the will to work with, support, and encourage others to do and be their best selves.</li>
                    <li>A classic example from my past as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ comes from forming relationships with companions with entirely contrasting background. The more we opened up and supported each other with our strengths and weaknesses, our work together became unified and powerful when teaching and studying together. It gave a sense of being unstoppable working in the Lord&rsquo;s vinyard.</li>
                </ul>
            <li class=" noBgColor"><strong>What can you do as an individual to initiate effective team behavior?</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Practice simple inter-personal skills such as those found in Dale Carnegie&rsquo;s book <u>How To Win Friends and Influence People</u>; some of which include:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Don&rsquo;t criticize, condemn or complain</li>
                    <li>Give honest and sincere appreciation [for contributions made by teammates]</li>
                    <li>Become genuinely interested in other people [in your group and what they have to say]</li>
                    <li>Smile</li>
                    <li>Remember and use names [when addressing anyone in the group]</li>
                    <li>Be a good listener; encourage others to talk about their personal experiences [relating to the discussion]</li>
                    <li>Make [teammates] feel important and do it sincerely</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </ol>
