<h2 style="margin-top: 30px;">RuneScape Gold Guide: Top 10 AFK Skilling Money Making Methods 2018</h2>
Date: March 14th, 2018
<p><span>This guide contains some new methods, and I hope it will help you make a decent amount of <strong>RuneScape Gold</strong> with little effort. If you don&rsquo;t have enough playing time to earn <strong>RuneScape Gold</strong> from Skilling, <strong>MmoGah</strong> will provide you with tons of safe and cheap.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>1. Cutting Elder Trees</span><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>To use this method, you need 90 Woodcutting. You are going to make 800K <strong><a href="/rs3-gold">RS3 Gold</a></strong>&nbsp;per hour by doing this, and it will require you to rotate between 3 trees every 5 minutes. This will give you a maximum AFK time of 5 minutes before you need to do any inputs. I advise you to rotate between Varrock, Edgeville, and Falador Elder Trees. You should use a Beaver, Lumberjack Aura/Outfit, Crystal Hatchet, and Perfect Juju Woodcutting Potion.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>2. Making Teleport Tablets</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Making Teleport Tablets is 800K-1M <strong>RS3 Gold</strong> per hour, and with <a href="http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Calculator:Magic/Tablets">this calculator</a>, you can find out which Tablets are the most profitable before you get started. This requires either a&nbsp;Friend&rsquo;s&nbsp;House or 67 Construction for the best Lectern. A Butler of any type can be used to consistently fetch Soft Clay from the Bank so that you never have to leave. You&rsquo;ll be able to AFK for over 1.5 minutes by doing this method.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>3. Prifddinas Thieving</span></strong></p>
<p><span>This gives you 600K+ <strong>RS3 Gold</strong> per hour and additional 400K various loot. You&rsquo;ll need 95 Thieving to thieve here with no downtime, and you should be using a Master Camouflage Outfit or the Trahaearn Exoskeleton set, Arde Cloak, and Five-finger Discount Aura. You should be AFK for upwards of 5 minutes before having to do any input.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>4. Making Cannonballs</span></strong></p>
<p><span>This is a pretty straightforward method by which you can get 1M <strong>RSGP</strong>/H by Smithing Cannonballs. You&rsquo;ll need the Morytania Legs 2 to smith Cannonballs and&nbsp;the Furnace in Port Phasmatys to be able to use this method. You simply fill your inventory with Steel Bars, and run to the Furnace to make Cannonballs.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>5. Fishing</span></strong></p>
<p><span>This is a newer method which requires 90&nbsp;Fishing, and there are 3 different spots to make 800K-1.1M <strong>RSGP</strong>/H in total.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You should use a Fury Outfit (if you own it), Call of the Sea Aura, a Granite Lobster, a Perfect Juju Fishing Potion, and Fishing Rod-o-Matic augmented with Perks, or Crystal Rod.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>First, fishing Blue Jellyfish gives 850K GP/H, and you should prioritize Electrified Jellies for faster catches.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Second, fishing at the Swarm spot is slightly more AFK, and it has a profit of 1.1M GP/H.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, you will make about 1M/H from&nbsp;Sailfish which are slightly less AFK, and&nbsp; you should prioritize the Swift spots for the fastest catch rate.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>6. String Jewellery</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You&rsquo;ll&nbsp;get about 1.3M <strong>RS3 Gold</strong>/H by Stringing Jewellery which requires 80 Magic to complete.&nbsp;</span><span>You should use <a href="http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/String_Jewellery">this page</a>&nbsp;for updated calculations, and you need to be equipped with a Mud Battlestaff when using this method. This method is very nice because all you have to do is casting the Spell once, and it will do your entire inventory, then you simply just bank with your preset and do it again.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>7. Making Urns</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You can&nbsp;mould and fire Urns, nice money but less AFK.You should use <a href="http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Calculator:Crafting/Urns">this page</a>&nbsp;find out which are the most profitable. &nbsp;A full inventory of firing Runes is around 2.5 minutes, but first you need to mould the Urns which takes around 40 seconds per inventory. You should equip the Artisan&rsquo;s Outfit if you own it, and use a Portable Crafter (W84 CA) as well.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>8. Harmonised Rune</span></strong></p>
<p><span>This is something that you&rsquo;ll only be able to do for 1 hour every 4 hours. This has a profit of over 2M <strong>RSGP</strong>/H and requires 95 mining. To use this method, you need to use the Friends chat: Harmed Ore, and the <a href="https://twitter.com/JagexClock">@JagexClock</a>&nbsp;Twitter account to track the Voice of Seren.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For Equipment Inventory, you&rsquo;ll need to use a Lave Titan, Perfect Juju Mining potion, Magic Golem Outfit, the Crystal Pickaxe, and Quarrymaster Aura for the best rates. If you have porters, you can use them to increase the level of AFK-ness of this method.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>9. Smithing Rune Bars</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You can get about 2.3M <strong>RS3 Gold</strong>/H by using this method which requires 85 Smithing. You&rsquo;ll need to use a Portable Forge (W84 CA), a Coal Bag, and Blacksmith&rsquo;s Outfit if you own it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You&rsquo;ll need to make a loadout with 12 pieces of Rune, a Coal Bag, and Coal. Make sure&nbsp;to set the left-click option on the Forge to Smelting, and then you are ready to go. This method will allow you to AFK for around half a minute. When you are banking, you&rsquo;ll be filling your Coal Bag by right-clicking on it and clicking Fill, then you press your preset key to get the rest of your ores out of the Bank.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>10. Harvesting Energy</span></strong></p>
<p><span>This has a profit of 2.3M <strong>RS Gold</strong>/H. To make the most profit, you should have 75 Divination, 86 Magic, and 81 Summoning. You can additionally use a slightly different method if you have 101 Invention.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You&rsquo;ll be using a Nightmare Muspah Pouch, a Prism of Dowsing Spell, the Ring of Whispers, and Elder Outfit. If you have 101 Invention, you&rsquo;ll be using the Divine Vacuum. When you get either the Elder Colony or the Incandescent Colony, you&rsquo;ll want to cast the Prism of Dowsing near a pack of Wisps. This will give you an increased rate of enriched Memories while also attracting Wisps. The Muspah Familiar is pretty much a requirement for this method as it will allow you to hold over twice the amount of Memories in your inventory.</span></p>
